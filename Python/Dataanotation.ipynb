    "# Coding Exercise: Decoding a Message from a Text File\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will develop a function named decode(message_file). This function should read an encoded message from a .txt file and return its decoded version as a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that you can write your code using any language and IDE you want (Python is preferred if possible, but not mandatory).\n",
    "\n",
    "Your function must be able to process an input file with the following format:\n",
    "\n",
    "3 love  \n",
    "6 computers  \n",
    "2 dogs  \n",
    "4 cats  \n",
    "1 I  \n",
    "5 you\n",
    "\n",
    "In this file, each line contains a number followed by a word. The task is to decode a hidden message based on the arrangement of these numbers into a \"pyramid\" structure. The numbers are placed into the pyramid in ascending order, with each line of the pyramid having one more number than the line above it. The smallest number is 1, and the numbers increase consecutively, like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1  \n",
    "  \n",
    " 2 3  \n",
    "\n",
    "4 5 6  \n",
    "\n",
    "The key to decoding the message is to use the words corresponding to the numbers at the end of each pyramid line (in this example, 1, 3, and 6). You should ignore all the other words. So for the example input file above, the message words are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1: I  \n",
    "\n",
    "3: love  \n",
    "\n",
    "6: computers\n",
    "\n",
    "and your function should return the string \"I love computers\"."

    "### Explanation of the steps\n",
    "1. The function first reads an encoded message from a text file. It then converts each line (number and word) into a key-value pair in a dictionary, where the number becomes the key and the word becomes the value message_dict (ln13-ln19).\n",
    "2. Next, it calculates the total number of words in the message. Using this number, it generates a sequence of triangular numbers that represent the end of each line in a pyramid structure as triangle_numbers (ln23-ln33).\n",
    "3. Finally, the function iterates through both the dictionary and the generated triangular numbers. For each triangular number, it checks if it exists as a key in the dictionary. If it does, it retrieves the corresponding word (value) and prints it, effectively decoding the hidden message line by line."
